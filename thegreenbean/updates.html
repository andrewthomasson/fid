  <h3>SUMMER DRINKS ARE HERE!</h3>

    <strong>Summer is in full swing</strong> at The Green Bean, and we’re thrilled to introduce our newest 
    seasonal drink: the <a href="visitus.html">Honey Citrus Cold Brew</a>. This refreshing twist on a classic favorite combines our 
    smooth, slow-steeped cold brew with a splash of bright citrus, a touch of local honey, and a hint of 
    vanilla for balance. Served over ice and garnished with a thin orange slice, it’s the perfect pick-me-up 
    for hot mornings, lazy afternoons, or anytime you need a cool burst of energy with a sweet, tangy finish.</p>

  <p>We crafted the <a href="visitus.html">Honey Citrus Cold Brew</a> with our community in mind—something light, vibrant, and 
    unmistakably summer. Whether you’re stopping by before heading to the beach or settling into our sunlit 
    café with a good book, this drink captures the essence of the season in every sip. It’s available for a 
    limited time, so swing by The Green Bean and taste summer while it lasts!</p>

    <h3>FESTIVAL FUN</h3>
    <p><em>Published <time datetime="2025-06-15">June 15, 2025</time></em></p>

    <strong>This past weekend</strong>, The Green Bean proudly joined the annual <a href="https://riversideartsmarket.org/" target="_blank">Riverside Arts Market</a> downtown—an 
    inspiring celebration of local creativity, music, and family fun. Our team rolled out our mobile espresso 
    cart to serve up complimentary iced lattes, mini cold brews, and delicious vegan pastries to festival-goers 
    enjoying live artwork and local bands. Over the course of the day, we handed out nearly 200 free drinks, 
    chatted with visitors about our café's journey from food truck to storefront, and received enthusiastic 
    feedback on our new Honey Citrus Cold Brew, which was a summertime hit even among the festival’s hottest moments.</p>    
    <p>In addition to serving coffee, we hosted a fun pop-up contest—festival attendees guessed the number of coffee 
        beans in a jar for a chance to win a Green Bean gift card and exclusive merch. Families gathered, kids cheered 
        on their guesses, and smiles were all around when our winner was announced late Saturday afternoon. It was 
        heartwarming to connect with our neighborhood on such a vibrant stage. A special thanks to the <a href="https://riversideartsmarket.org/" target="_blank">Riverside Arts 
        Market</a> organizers and our amazing staff for helping make the day so bright. We’re grateful for every 
        conversation sparked and every new face who discovered our humble café through this community event.
