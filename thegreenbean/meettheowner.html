  <h3>MEET JEFF</h3>
  
  <p><img src="jeff.jpg" alt="portrait of Jeff" class="meettheowner-img">
    Jeff Smith, founder of The Green Bean, is a 35-year-old coffee enthusiast with a 
    heart for hospitality and a deep-rooted love for his community. With over a decade 
    of experience in the food and beverage industry, Jeff took a leap of faith five 
    years ago by launching The Green Bean from a refurbished food truck. He believed 
    that coffee could do more than just wake people up—it could bring them together. 
    That vision quickly gained traction, turning a street-side operation into a local 
    favorite, and eventually into a welcoming brick-and-mortar café known for its warm 
    atmosphere and thoughtfully crafted drinks.</p>
    <p>Beyond the café, Jeff is a devoted husband and proud father of two, balancing 
        early morning roasts and business strategy with school pickups and family dinners. 
        He’s known for remembering customers’ names and orders, jumping behind the counter 
        during busy hours, and supporting local artists, bakers, and fellow small business 
        owners. Jeff’s commitment to quality and community is the heartbeat of The Green Bean, 
        and his approachable, hands-on leadership style has helped turn a small coffee 
        venture into a beloved neighborhood staple.</p>
